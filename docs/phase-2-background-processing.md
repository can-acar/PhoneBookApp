# Phase 2: Background Job Processing - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Phase 2: Background Job Processing for the ReportService component of the TelefonRehberiApp (Phone Book App). The primary goal of this phase was to implement asynchronous report generation using Apache Kafka as a message queue, replacing the previous synchronous Task.Run approach with a more robust message-based architecture.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Kafka Configuration

- **Settings Class**: Created `KafkaSettings` and `KafkaTopics` classes to store Kafka configuration.
- **Configuration in appsettings.json**: Added Kafka configuration to both production and development environments.
- **Docker Compose**: Updated the docker-compose.yaml file to include Kafka, Zookeeper, and a Kafka UI for local development and testing.

### 2. Message Models

- Created message models for Kafka communication:
  - `ReportRequestMessage`: Used to request report generation
  - `ReportCompletedMessage`: Used to notify about report completion

### 3. Kafka Producer

- Implemented `KafkaProducer` class with the following capabilities:
  - Publishing report request messages
  - Publishing report completion messages
  - Support for message headers, including correlation ID for distributed tracing

### 4. Kafka Consumer

- Implemented `ReportRequestConsumer` class to handle report generation requests:
  - Subscribes to the report-requests topic
  - Processes incoming messages
  - Extracts correlation IDs for request tracing
  - Delegates to ReportGenerator for actual report generation
  - Publishes completion messages back to Kafka

### 5. Background Services

- **ReportProcessingService**: A background service that manages the Kafka consumer lifecycle
- **ReportCompletedConsumer**: A background service that listens for report completion events

### 6. Report Generation

- **ReportGenerator**: Enhanced to support asynchronous report generation
  - Retrieves data from ContactService
  - Aggregates data by location
  - Updates report status
  - Supports correlation IDs for request tracing

### 7. Testing

- Added unit tests for the report processing components
- Added test helpers for mocking Kafka components

## Architecture

The background job processing architecture follows these steps:

1. **Request Submission**: User submits a report generation request through the API
2. **Message Publishing**: CreateReportHandler publishes a ReportRequestMessage to Kafka
3. **Asynchronous Processing**: ReportRequestConsumer processes the message and generates the report
4. **Completion Notification**: ReportRequestConsumer publishes a completion message to Kafka
5. **Status Update**: ReportCompletedConsumer updates the report status and could trigger notifications

## Configuration

### Kafka Topics

- `report-requests`: For report generation requests
- `report-completed`: For report completion notifications
- Development variants with `-dev` suffix for testing

### Docker Compose Setup

The docker-compose.yaml file includes:
- Zookeeper for Kafka cluster management
- Kafka broker
- Kafka UI for monitoring and managing topics
- Kafka setup service for topic initialization

## Testing

To test the background job processing:

1. Start the Docker environment: `docker-compose up -d`
2. Access the Kafka UI at http://localhost:8080
3. Submit a report request through the ReportService API
4. Monitor the Kafka topics for messages
5. Check the report status in the database

## Next Steps

- Implement proper error handling and dead letter queues
- Add metrics and monitoring for Kafka consumers and producers
- Implement message retries and backoff strategies
- Consider adding a notification service that subscribes to report completion events
- Implement circuit breakers for resilience
